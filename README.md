This Rucoy Online bot is designed to automate the process of leveling your warrior character and farming items by killing Minotaurs. Use this script at your own risk. Rucoy Online strictly prohibits the use of bots, and using this script may result in a permanent ban from the game. Proceed with extreme caution and understand that you are solely responsible for any consequences.

This script is specifically designed to work only in the Minotaur location. It prioritizes attacking Minotaurs closest to your character. What makes this bot unique is its built-in reconnection feature. In the event of a disconnection, whether due to internet issues, prolonged AFK periods, or any other reason, the script will automatically attempt to reconnect and resume farming from where you left off, ensuring uninterrupted training. No complex setup is required; simply run the provided executable for an effortless experience.

To use:

  1. Navigate to the run.dist folder.
  2. Double-click run.exe.
  3. Adjust the delay settings as needed to optimize performance and avoid detection.

Important Considerations:

  This script currently only functions in fullscreen mode. Support for different resolutions will be added in future updates. HEllo
